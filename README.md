## 🏛️ Architecture Patterns

### Selectors Pattern
All database queries go through selector classes in `app/selectors.py`:
```python
# ✅ Correct - Use selectors
data = UserSelector.get_by_id(user_id)

# ❌ Incorrect - Direct model queries in services/API
data = User.objects.get(id=user_id)
```

### Service Layer
Business logic goes in service classes:
```python
# ✅ Correct - Use services for business logic
result = UserService.create_user(data)

# ❌ Incorrect - Business logic in API endpoints
user = User.objects.create(**data)
```

### Logging System
Standard Python logging with Django configuration:
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

logger.info(f"Operation completed - User ID: {user.id}")
logger.error(f"Operation failed - Error: {str(e)}")
```

The project uses a custom logging wrapper (`core.logger`) for consistent logging across the application. See [Logging Documentation](./docs/logging.md) for more details.
